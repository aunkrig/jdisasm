 * Annotations for ECLIPSE's "null analysis" feature.
 * <p>
 *   The following settings on the 'Java / Compiler / Errors/Warnings' preference page (or the 'Java Compiler /
 *   Errors/Warnings' project properties page) are recommended:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * <b>Null analysis</b>
 *   Null pointer access:                                                      [Error   ]   4.2+
 *   Potential null pointer access:                                            [Error   ]   4.2+
 *   Redundant null check:                                                     [Warning ]   4.2+
 *    [x] Include 'assert' in null analysis                                                 4.2+
 *    [x] Enable annotation-based null analysis                                             4.2+
 *        Violation of null specification:                                     [Warning ]   4.2+
 *        Conflict between null annotations and null inference:                [Warning ]   4.2+
 *        Unchecked conversion from non-annotated type to @NonNull type:       [Ignore  ]   4.2+
 *        Redundant null annotation:                                           [Warning ]   4.2+
 *        '@NonNull' parameter not annotated in overriding method:             [Warning ]   4.3+
 *        Missing '@NonNullByDefault' annotation on package                    [Warning ]   4.2+
 *        [ ] Use default annotations for null specifications (Configure...)                4.2+
 *        [ ] Inherit null annotations                                                      4.3+
 *        [x] Enable syntactic null analysis for fields                                     4.3+
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 *   Through the Configure... link, you should configure the following:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *    'Nullable' annotation:         [de.unkrig.jdisasm.commons.nullanalysis.Nullable         ]
 *    'NonNull' annotation:          [de.unkrig.jdisasm.commons.nullanalysis.NotNull          ]
 *    'NonNullByDefault' annotation: [de.unkrig.jdisasm.commons.nullanalysis.NotNullByDefault ]
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 *   (ECLIPSE Version: JUNO / 4.2, HELIOS / 4.3)
